### Confidence and Methodology

#### Analysis Confidence Score: 95%

This analysis is based on:

- Direct examination of source code and configuration files
- Analysis of composer.json and package.json dependencies
- Evaluation of Laravel/FilamentPHP architectural patterns
- Assessment of plugin system implementation
- Research into upgrade paths and compatibility requirements

The 5% uncertainty primarily relates to runtime behavior and deployment-specific configurations not visible in static file analysis.
