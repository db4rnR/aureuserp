# 11. Code Quality and Testing

This document serves as an index for the code quality and testing documentation for the AureusERP project.

## 11.1. Overview

AureusERP maintains high code quality standards through a combination of automated tools, testing frameworks, and continuous integration practices. This documentation provides comprehensive, step-by-step instructions on configuring these tools and making them available as composer scripts.

## 11.2. Documentation Structure

The code quality and testing documentation is organized into the following sections:

1. [Code Quality and Testing](120-code-quality-and-testing/) - All code quality and testing documentation
   - [Code Quality Tools](120-code-quality-and-testing/010-code-quality.md) - Setup and configuration of code quality tools
   - [Testing with Pest](120-code-quality-and-testing/020-testing.md) - Comprehensive testing setup with Pest
   - [CI/CD and Pre-commit Hooks](120-code-quality-and-testing/030-ci-cd.md) - GitHub Actions and pre-commit hooks

## 11.3. Key Components

### 11.3.1. Code Quality Tools

AureusERP uses several tools to ensure code quality:

- **Laravel Pint** - Code style fixer based on PHP-CS-Fixer
- **PHPStan** - Static analysis tool
- **Rector** - Automated code upgrades and refactoring
- **PHP Insights** - Code quality and architecture analysis

See [Code Quality Tools](120-code-quality-and-testing/010-code-quality.md) for detailed setup instructions.

### 11.3.2. Testing Framework

AureusERP uses Pest for testing:

- **Unit Tests** - Testing individual components
- **Feature Tests** - Testing application features
- **Integration Tests** - Testing component interactions
- **Browser Tests** - Testing with Laravel Dusk

See [Testing with Pest](120-code-quality-and-testing/020-testing.md) for detailed setup instructions.

### 11.3.3. CI/CD and Pre-commit Hooks

AureusERP uses GitHub Actions and pre-commit hooks for continuous integration and deployment:

- **GitHub Actions** - Automated workflows for testing and deployment
- **Pre-commit Hooks** - Ensuring code quality before commits
- **Continuous Deployment** - Automated deployment with Deployer

See [CI/CD and Pre-commit Hooks](120-code-quality-and-testing/030-ci-cd.md) for detailed setup instructions.

## 11.4. Quick Start

To get started with code quality and testing in AureusERP:

1. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
composer install
```

2. Run code quality checks:

```bash
composer analyze
```

3. Run tests:

```bash
composer test
```

4. Fix code quality issues:

```bash
composer fix
```

5. Set up pre-commit hooks:

```bash
pre-commit install
```

## 11.5. Composer Scripts

AureusERP provides several composer scripts for code quality and testing:

```json
{
    "scripts": {
        "pint": "pint",
        "pint:test": "pint --test",
        "phpstan": "phpstan analyse",
        "rector": "rector process",
        "rector:dry-run": "rector process --dry-run",
        "insights": "phpinsights",
        "analyze": [
            "@pint:test",
            "@phpstan",
            "@rector:dry-run",
            "@insights"
        ],
        "fix": [
            "@pint",
            "@rector"
        ],
        "test": "pest",
        "test:coverage": "pest --coverage",
        "test:coverage-html": "pest --coverage --coverage-html=reports/coverage",
        "test:parallel": "pest --parallel",
        "test:type-coverage": "pest --type-coverage",
        "test:arch": "pest --group=arch",
        "test:stress": "pest --group=stress",
        "test:unit": "pest --group=unit",
        "test:feature": "pest --group=feature",
        "test:integration": "pest --group=integration"
    }
}
```

## 11.6. Best Practices

1. **Run code quality checks before committing**: Use pre-commit hooks to ensure code quality.
2. **Write tests for all new features**: Follow Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles.
3. **Maintain high code coverage**: Aim for at least 90% code coverage.
4. **Review code quality reports**: Regularly review code quality reports and address issues.
5. **Keep dependencies up to date**: Regularly update dependencies to ensure security and performance.
6. **Document code quality requirements**: Document code quality requirements for new features.
7. **Automate as much as possible**: Use automation to reduce manual errors.
8. **Follow Laravel best practices**: Adhere to Laravel 12 best practices and customs.
9. **Use type declarations**: Use PHP 8.4 type declarations for better type safety.
10. **Keep documentation up to date**: Update documentation when code quality requirements change.
