# Proposed File Moves to tools/ Directory

Below is the list of files that I propose to move to the `tools/` directory. These files are utilities, scripts, or configuration files for development tools that aren't part of the main application code.

## Files to be moved:

1. **rename_transcripts.sh** -> tools/rename_transcripts.sh
   - A shell script that renames transcript files with date-time stamp prefixes

## Please confirm if you approve these moves or if you'd like to make any changes to the list.
