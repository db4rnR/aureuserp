# Testing Framework Improvement: Expanding Test Coverage

This commit continues our testing framework improvement initiative, focusing on expanding test coverage for the AureusERP plugins.

## Changes Made

- Created a comprehensive document identifying and prioritizing all plugins for test implementation
- Implemented unit tests for all models in the Invoices plugin:
  - Attribute
  - BankAccount
  - Category
  - CreditNote
  - Incoterm
  - Partner
  - Payment
  - Refund
  - Tax
  - TaxGroup
- Implemented unit tests for all models in the Payments plugin:
  - Payment
  - PaymentToken
  - PaymentTransaction
- Updated task tracking documentation to reflect progress

## Technical Details

The new tests verify:
- Proper inheritance from base classes
- Correct attribute values and relationships
- Proper implementation of traits and interfaces
- Boot methods functionality (for BankAccount)
- Category hierarchy and full_name generation (for Category)
- Sequence prefix generation (for CreditNote)

The BankAccount test specifically verifies that the account_holder_name is properly set and updated based on the partner's name, as implemented in the model's boot methods.

The Category test includes verification of the category hierarchy functionality, ensuring that parent-child relationships are correctly established and that the full_name is properly generated based on the hierarchy.

The CreditNote test verifies the sequence prefix generation functionality, ensuring that the correct prefix is generated based on the move_type (OUT_REFUND generates 'RINV/' prefix).

The Incoterm test verifies the inheritance from the base Account Incoterm class, ensuring that all attributes and relationships are properly inherited and that the model uses the SoftDeletes trait.

The Partner test verifies the complex inheritance chain (Invoice Partner extends Account Partner extends Base Partner), tests the additional fillable fields from the Account Partner class, and verifies the functionality of methods like getAvatarUrlAttribute and canAccessPanel. It also tests the relationships with various models including Country, State, User, Title, Company, Industry, BankAccount, and Tag.

The Payment test verifies the inheritance from the base Account Payment class, tests the attributes and relationships, and verifies the model's traits and log attributes. It also tests the relationships with various models including Move, Journal, Company, BankAccount, PaymentMethodLine, PaymentMethod, Currency, Partner, Account, User, PaymentTransaction, and PaymentToken.

The Refund test verifies the inheritance from the base Account Move class, tests the attributes and relationships, and verifies the model's traits. It also tests the sequence prefix generation functionality, ensuring that the correct prefix is generated based on the move_type (IN_REFUND generates 'RBILL/' prefix).

The Tax test verifies the inheritance from the base Account Tax class, tests the attributes and relationships, and verifies the model's traits and interfaces. It also tests the boot method that automatically creates distribution records for invoice and refund when a tax is created, and verifies the parent-child relationships between taxes.

The TaxGroup test verifies the inheritance from the base Account TaxGroup class, tests the attributes and relationships, and verifies the model's traits and interfaces. It also tests the sortable configuration to ensure that tax groups can be properly ordered.

The Payments plugin tests verify the basic properties of the Payment, PaymentToken, and PaymentTransaction models. Since these models are very simple (they only extend the base Eloquent Model class and use the HasFactory trait), the tests focus on verifying that the models exist, extend the correct base class, use the expected traits, and have the correct table names.

## Next Steps

With all models in the Invoices and Payments plugins now having unit tests, the next steps are to:
1. Implement unit tests for models in the next plugin (Products) according to the prioritization document
2. Implement Feature tests for HTTP endpoints in each selected plugin
3. Develop Integration tests for service classes in each selected plugin
4. Ensure test coverage for critical business logic in each plugin
5. Verify all tests pass and provide meaningful feedback on failures
