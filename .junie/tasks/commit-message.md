# Testing Framework Improvement: Expanding Test Coverage

This commit continues our testing framework improvement initiative, focusing on expanding test coverage for the AureusERP plugins.

## Changes Made

- Created a comprehensive document identifying and prioritizing all plugins for test implementation
- Implemented unit tests for all models in the Invoices plugin:
  - Attribute
  - BankAccount
  - Category
  - CreditNote
  - Incoterm
  - Partner
  - Payment
  - Refund
  - Tax
  - TaxGroup
- Implemented unit tests for all models in the Payments plugin:
  - Payment
  - PaymentToken
  - PaymentTransaction
- Implemented unit tests for all models in the Products plugin:
  - Attribute
  - AttributeOption
  - Category
  - Packaging
  - PriceList
  - PriceRule
  - PriceRuleItem
  - Product
  - ProductAttribute
  - ProductAttributeValue
  - ProductCombination
  - ProductSupplier
  - Tag
- Implemented feature tests for resources in the Invoices plugin:
  - CreditNotesResource
  - PartnerResource
  - InvoiceResource
  - PaymentsResource
  - ProductResource
- Updated task tracking documentation to reflect progress

## Technical Details

The new tests verify:
- Proper inheritance from base classes
- Correct attribute values and relationships
- Proper implementation of traits and interfaces
- Boot methods functionality (for BankAccount)
- Category hierarchy and full_name generation (for Category)
- Sequence prefix generation (for CreditNote)

The BankAccount test specifically verifies that the account_holder_name is properly set and updated based on the partner's name, as implemented in the model's boot methods.

The Category test includes verification of the category hierarchy functionality, ensuring that parent-child relationships are correctly established and that the full_name is properly generated based on the hierarchy.

The CreditNote test verifies the sequence prefix generation functionality, ensuring that the correct prefix is generated based on the move_type (OUT_REFUND generates 'RINV/' prefix).

The Incoterm test verifies the inheritance from the base Account Incoterm class, ensuring that all attributes and relationships are properly inherited and that the model uses the SoftDeletes trait.

The Partner test verifies the complex inheritance chain (Invoice Partner extends Account Partner extends Base Partner), tests the additional fillable fields from the Account Partner class, and verifies the functionality of methods like getAvatarUrlAttribute and canAccessPanel. It also tests the relationships with various models including Country, State, User, Title, Company, Industry, BankAccount, and Tag.

The Payment test verifies the inheritance from the base Account Payment class, tests the attributes and relationships, and verifies the model's traits and log attributes. It also tests the relationships with various models including Move, Journal, Company, BankAccount, PaymentMethodLine, PaymentMethod, Currency, Partner, Account, User, PaymentTransaction, and PaymentToken.

The Refund test verifies the inheritance from the base Account Move class, tests the attributes and relationships, and verifies the model's traits. It also tests the sequence prefix generation functionality, ensuring that the correct prefix is generated based on the move_type (IN_REFUND generates 'RBILL/' prefix).

The Tax test verifies the inheritance from the base Account Tax class, tests the attributes and relationships, and verifies the model's traits and interfaces. It also tests the boot method that automatically creates distribution records for invoice and refund when a tax is created, and verifies the parent-child relationships between taxes.

The TaxGroup test verifies the inheritance from the base Account TaxGroup class, tests the attributes and relationships, and verifies the model's traits and interfaces. It also tests the sortable configuration to ensure that tax groups can be properly ordered.

The Payments plugin tests verify the basic properties of the Payment, PaymentToken, and PaymentTransaction models. Since these models are very simple (they only extend the base Eloquent Model class and use the HasFactory trait), the tests focus on verifying that the models exist, extend the correct base class, use the expected traits, and have the correct table names.

The Products plugin tests verify a wide range of functionality including:
- Attribute and AttributeOption models with their sortable configuration and relationships
- Category model with its hierarchy functionality and parent-child relationships
- Packaging model with its relationships to products and companies
- PriceList and PriceRule models with their currency and company relationships
- PriceRuleItem model with its complex relationships and enum type casts
- Product model with its variants, attributes, and supplier information
- ProductAttribute and ProductAttributeValue models with their relationships to products and attributes
- ProductCombination model with its role in configurable products
- ProductSupplier model with its date range functionality and supplier selection logic
- Tag model with its relationships to products

The ProductSupplier tests specifically verify date range functionality for supplier validity periods, allowing the system to determine which suppliers are currently active. They also demonstrate how to find the cheapest supplier or suppliers that can fulfill specific quantity requirements.

The ProductCombination tests verify the complex relationships between configurable products, their variants, and the attribute combinations that define them, ensuring that product variants are correctly associated with their attribute values.

The Feature tests for the Invoices plugin resources verify that the HTTP endpoints for managing invoices, credit notes, partners, payments, and products are working correctly. These tests ensure that users can view, create, edit, and manage these resources through the web interface. The tests specifically verify:
- Resource listing pages load successfully
- Resource creation pages load successfully
- Resources can be created with valid data
- Resources can be viewed and edited
- Special pages like product attributes and variants load correctly

## Next Steps

With all models in the Invoices, Payments, and Products plugins now having unit tests, and Feature tests implemented for the Invoices plugin resources, the next steps are to:
1. Continue implementing Feature tests for HTTP endpoints in the Payments and Products plugins
2. Develop Integration tests for service classes in each selected plugin
3. Ensure test coverage for critical business logic in each plugin
4. Verify all tests pass and provide meaningful feedback on failures
