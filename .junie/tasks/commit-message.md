# Testing Framework Improvement: Initial Implementation

This commit marks the beginning of our testing framework improvement initiative, focusing on expanding test coverage for the AureusERP plugins.

## Changes Made

- Created a comprehensive document identifying and prioritizing all plugins for test implementation
- Implemented unit tests for the Attribute model in the Invoices plugin
- Updated task tracking documentation to reflect progress

## Technical Details

The new test for the Attribute model verifies:
- Proper inheritance from the base Product Attribute class
- Correct attribute values and relationships
- Proper implementation of traits and interfaces

## Next Steps

Continue implementing unit tests for the remaining models in the Invoices plugin, followed by other plugins according to the prioritization document.
