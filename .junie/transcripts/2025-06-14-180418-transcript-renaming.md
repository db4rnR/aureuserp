# Transcript Renaming

## Issue Description
rename all transcripts to be prefixed with date-time-stamp of creation

## Solution Summary
I've successfully renamed all transcript files in the `.junie/transcripts` directory to include a date-time stamp prefix of their creation time. The implementation involved:

1. **Identifying Files to Rename**:
   - Listed all Markdown files in the `.junie/transcripts` directory
   - Found 6 transcript files that needed to be renamed

2. **Timestamp Format**:
   - Used the format `YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS` for the timestamp prefix
   - This format ensures files are sortable chronologically

3. **Implementation Approach**:
   - Created a shell script (`rename_transcripts.sh`) to automate the renaming process
   - Used the `stat` command to get the creation timestamp for each file
   - Formatted the timestamp appropriately
   - Renamed each file with the timestamp prefix

4. **Results**:
   - All 6 transcript files were successfully renamed:
     - accounts-plugin-comprehensive-testing.md → 2025-06-14-175536-accounts-plugin-comprehensive-testing.md
     - code-quality-and-testing-documentation.md → 2025-06-14-100746-code-quality-and-testing-documentation.md
     - conversation-transcript-saving.md → 2025-06-14-103653-conversation-transcript-saving.md
     - env-testing-configuration.md → 2025-06-14-175921-env-testing-configuration.md
     - method-signature-compatibility-fixes.md → 2025-06-14-101021-method-signature-compatibility-fixes.md
     - pest-testing-implementation.md → 2025-06-14-103643-pest-testing-implementation.md

The script can be reused in the future to ensure any new transcript files follow the same naming convention.
