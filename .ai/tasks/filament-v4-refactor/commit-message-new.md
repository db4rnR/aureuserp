## Technical Implementation

### Migration Scripts Applied

**Import Migration Script**:
- **Files Processed**: 74 files across 7 plugins
- **Success Rate**: 100%
- **Script**: `.ai/tasks/filament-v4-refactor/scripts/import-migration.php`
- **Function**: Automated replacement of old Schema imports with appropriate Form/Infolist imports

**Method Signature Migration Script**:
- **Files Processed**: 1 file (partners/BankResource.php)
- **Success Rate**: 100%
- **Script**: `.ai/tasks/filament-v4-refactor/scripts/method-signature-migration.php`
- **Function**: Fixed old Schema method signatures to FilamentPHP v4 patterns

### Systematic Plugin Processing

**Phase 1 - Critical Priority Plugins**:
- ✅ **partners**: Fixed 14 files with mixed v3/v4 patterns
- ✅ **timesheets**: Fixed 1 file with Schema imports
- ✅ **employees**: Fixed 21 files with Schema imports

**Phase 2 - High Priority Plugins**:
- ✅ **blogs**: Fixed 4 files with Schema imports
- ✅ **products**: Fixed 9 files with Schema imports
- ✅ **sales**: Fixed 17 files with Schema imports
- ✅ **purchases**: Fixed 8 files with Schema imports

### Migration Patterns Applied

**Import Statement Updates**:
- `use Filament\Schemas\Schema;` → `use Filament\Forms\Form;` (for form methods)
- `use Filament\Schemas\Schema;` → `use Filament\Infolists\Infolist;` (for infolist methods)
- `use Filament\Schemas\Components\*` → `use Filament\Forms\Components\*` (form context)
- `use Filament\Schemas\Components\*` → `use Filament\Infolists\Components\*` (infolist context)
- `use Filament\Schemas\Components\Utilities\Get` → `use Filament\Forms\Get`
- `use Filament\Schemas\Components\Utilities\Set` → `use Filament\Forms\Set`

**Method Signature Updates**:
- `form(Schema $schema): Schema` → `form(Form $form): Form`
- `infolist(Schema $schema): Schema` → `infolist(Infolist $infolist): Infolist`
- `$schema->components([])` → `$form->schema([])` or `$infolist->schema([])`

**Namespace Pattern Fixes**:
- `\Filament\Schemas\Components\Group` → `\Filament\Infolists\Components\Group`
- `\Filament\Schemas\Components\Tab` → `\Filament\Forms\Components\Tabs\Tab`

## Quality Assurance and Validation

### Automated Validation Process

**Migration Completeness Validator**:
- Comprehensive scanning of all 2,703 files
- Pattern matching for old Schema imports and method signatures
- Automated reporting of migration status and remaining issues
- Validation of FilamentPHP v4 compliance patterns

**Validation Results by Plugin**:

| Plugin | Files Validated | Valid Files | Issues | Completion |
|--------|----------------|-------------|--------|------------|
| partners | 66 | 66 | 0 | 100% |
| timesheets | 6 | 6 | 0 | 100% |
| employees | 197 | 197 | 0 | 100% |
| blogs | 48 | 48 | 0 | 100% |
| products | 104 | 103 | 1 | 99.04% |
| sales | 230 | 228 | 2 | 99.13% |
| purchases | 205 | 203 | 2 | 99.02% |
| accounts | 359 | 358 | 1 | 99.72% |

### Backward Compatibility Assurance
