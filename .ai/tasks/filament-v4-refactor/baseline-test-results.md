## Plugin Test Coverage Analysis

### Plugins with Test Directories

1. **Accounts Plugin**
   - Directory: `tests/Unit/Plugins/Accounts/`
   - Test Files: 1 (SimpleAccountTest.php)
   - Status: ✅ Working (1 test passing)

2. **Invoices Plugin**
   - Directory: `tests/Unit/Plugins/Invoices/`
   - Test Files: 0 (directory exists but empty)
   - Status: ⚠️ No tests found

3. **Payments Plugin**
   - Directory: `tests/Unit/Plugins/Payments/Models/`
   - Test Files: 3 (PaymentTest.php, PaymentTransactionTest.php, PaymentTokenTest.php)
   - Status: ⚠️ Tests exist but not discovered by Pest

4. **Products Plugin**
   - Directory: `tests/Unit/Plugins/Products/Models/`
   - Test Files: 10+ (various model tests)
   - Status: ⚠️ Tests exist but not discovered by Pest

### Plugins without Test Coverage

The following 18 plugins have no test directories or files:
- analytics
- blogs
- chatter
- contacts
- employees
- fields
- inventories
- partners
- projects
- purchases
- recruitments
- sales
- security
- support
- table-views
- time-off
- timesheets
- website

## Test Discovery Issues

**Problem:** Pest is not discovering tests in Payments and Products plugin directories despite test files existing.

**Possible Causes:**
1. Test file syntax issues
2. Missing namespace declarations
3. Pest configuration not including these directories
4. PHP attribute usage incompatibility

**Example Test File Structure (Payments/Models/PaymentTest.php):**
- Uses PHP attributes (#[Test], #[Group], etc.)
- Function-based Pest syntax
- Custom #[PluginTest] attribute
- Proper expect() assertions

## Recommendations for Migration

1. **Fix Test Discovery Issues:**
   - Investigate why Payments and Products tests aren't running
   - Verify Pest configuration includes all test directories
   - Check for syntax errors in test files

2. **Resolve Failing Tests:**
   - Fix Feature test redirect issue (302 → 200)
   - Set up proper test database for Integration tests

3. **Expand Test Coverage:**
   - Create tests for 18 plugins currently without coverage
   - Add Feature tests for Filament resources
   - Add Integration tests for plugin interactions

4. **Post-Migration Validation:**
   - All currently passing tests must continue to pass
   - Test discovery issues should be resolved
   - New tests should be added for migrated components

## Migration Testing Strategy

1. **Before Each Plugin Migration:**
   - Run existing tests for that plugin
   - Document current functionality

2. **After Each Plugin Migration:**
   - Run all tests to ensure no regression
   - Verify migrated components work identically
   - Add new tests for v4-specific functionality

3. **Final Validation:**
   - 100% test pass rate requirement
   - All plugins tested individually
   - Full integration test suite passing
