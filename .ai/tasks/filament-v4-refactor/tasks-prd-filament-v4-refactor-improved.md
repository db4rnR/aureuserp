### Notes

#### For PHP/Laravel Projects:
- Unit tests should be placed in the `tests/Unit` directory, mirroring the structure of the plugin directories
- Feature tests should be placed in the `tests/Feature` directory
- Use `php artisan test` or `./vendor/bin/pest` to run tests. Add `--filter=TestClassName` to run specific tests
- For Pest tests, use `./vendor/bin/pest --coverage` to generate coverage reports
- Each plugin should be tested individually after refactoring before moving to the next
- Follow the existing `.ai/guidelines` patterns for consistent code structure

2. **Complex Migration Cases:** Large plugins (employees, sales, inventories) may have complex patterns
3. **Test Environment:** Database and environment setup for comprehensive testing

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Incremental Approach:** Complete one plugin at a time with full validation
2. **Rollback Procedures:** Maintain ability to rollback individual plugin migrations
3. **Staging Environment:** Use dedicated testing environment for validation
4. **Documentation:** Maintain detailed logs of all changes and issues

## Success Criteria

Task 7.0 will be considered ready when:

1. **100% Plugin Migration:** All main project plugins fully migrated and validated
2. **Comprehensive Testing:** All plugins have adequate test coverage and pass
3. **Performance Validation:** No performance degradation detected
4. **Documentation Accuracy:** Task list reflects actual completion status
5. **Tool Validation:** All migration tools working correctly
6. **Integration Verification:** Cross-plugin functionality confirmed working

## Key Improvements in This Version

1. **Enhanced Status Tracking:** Clear status indicators for all tasks with realistic completion states
2. **Critical Task Addition:** New tasks 7.0 and 8.0 address identified blocking issues
3. **Readiness Framework:** Comprehensive checklist and validation requirements for Task 10.0
