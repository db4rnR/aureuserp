# Plugin Backup Strategy for FilamentPHP v4 Migration

## Overview
This document outlines the backup strategy for all 20 webkul plugins before beginning the FilamentPHP v4 migration. This ensures we have a complete safety net and can restore to the current state if needed.

## Current Plugin State Documentation

### Plugin Inventory
Based on analysis, the following 20 plugins are currently in the system:

1. **accounts** - Financial account management
2. **analytics** - Data analytics and reporting
3. **blogs** - Blog content management
4. **chatter** - Communication and messaging
5. **contacts** - Contact management
6. **employees** - Employee management
7. **fields** - Custom field management
8. **inventories** - Inventory management
9. **invoices** - Invoice management
10. **partners** - Partner relationship management
11. **payments** - Payment processing
12. **products** - Product catalog management
13. **projects** - Project management
14. **purchases** - Purchase order management
15. **recruitments** - Recruitment and hiring
16. **sales** - Sales management
17. **security** - Security and access control
18. **support** - Customer support
19. **table-views** - Custom table view management
20. **time-off** - Time off management
21. **timesheets** - Timesheet management
22. **website** - Website content management

### Current Schema Usage Analysis
All plugins currently use the custom `Filament\Schemas\*` pattern that needs migration:

#### Form Methods Using Schema Pattern
- **Total Files**: 100+ resource files
- **Pattern**: `public static function form(Schema $schema): Schema`
- **Components**: Using `Filament\Schemas\Components\*` imports

#### Infolist Methods Using Schema Pattern
- **Total Files**: 88 resource files
- **Pattern**: `public static function infolist(Schema $schema): Schema`
- **Components**: Using `Filament\Schemas\Components\*` imports

## Git-Based Backup Strategy

### 1. Current State Snapshot
The current state is already tracked in git. Before starting migration:

```bash
# Ensure all changes are committed
git add .
git commit -m "Pre-migration snapshot: Current state before FilamentPHP v4 refactoring"

# Create a backup branch from current state
git checkout -b backup/pre-filament-v4-migration
git push origin backup/pre-filament-v4-migration

# Return to main development branch
git checkout main
```

### 2. Plugin-Specific Backup Branches
For each plugin migration, create individual backup points:

```bash
# Before migrating each plugin
git checkout -b backup/pre-migration-[plugin-name]
git push origin backup/pre-migration-[plugin-name]
git checkout main
```

### 3. Migration Branch Strategy
```bash
# Create main migration branch
git checkout -b feature/filament-v4-migration
git push origin feature/filament-v4-migration
```

## File System Backup (Additional Safety)

### Critical Files to Monitor
- `plugins/webkul/*/src/Filament/Resources/*Resource.php`
- `plugins/webkul/*/src/Filament/Resources/*/Pages/*.php`
- `plugins/webkul/*/src/Filament/Components/*.php`
- `plugins/webkul/*/composer.json`
- `composer.json` (root)
- `tests/Unit/Plugins/*/`
- `tests/Feature/Plugins/*/`

### Backup Verification Checklist
- [ ] All current changes committed to git
- [ ] Backup branch created and pushed
- [ ] Current test results documented
- [ ] Plugin functionality verified and documented
- [ ] Database schema documented (no changes expected)

## Current Functionality Baseline

### Testing Baseline
Before migration, establish baseline test results:
```bash
# Run all plugin tests and document results
./vendor/bin/pest --group=accounts > .ai/tasks/filament-v4-refactor/baseline-test-accounts.log
./vendor/bin/pest --group=invoices > .ai/tasks/filament-v4-refactor/baseline-test-invoices.log
./vendor/bin/pest --group=products > .ai/tasks/filament-v4-refactor/baseline-test-products.log
# ... continue for all plugins
```

### Functional Verification
Document current working state:
- [ ] All forms load and save data correctly
- [ ] All infolists display data properly
- [ ] All tables filter, sort, and search correctly
- [ ] All actions execute successfully
- [ ] All notifications work properly

## Recovery Procedures

### Quick Recovery (Git Reset)
```bash
# If migration fails, reset to backup branch
git checkout backup/pre-filament-v4-migration
git checkout -b recovery/rollback-$(date +%Y%m%d)
```

### Plugin-Specific Recovery
```bash
# Restore specific plugin from backup
git checkout backup/pre-migration-[plugin-name] -- plugins/webkul/[plugin-name]/
git commit -m "Restore [plugin-name] from backup"
```

### Full System Recovery
```bash
# Complete rollback to pre-migration state
git reset --hard backup/pre-filament-v4-migration
```

## Backup Validation

### Pre-Migration Checklist
- [ ] Git repository is clean (no uncommitted changes)
- [ ] All tests pass with current implementation
- [ ] Backup branches created and verified
- [ ] Current functionality documented
- [ ] Recovery procedures tested

### Post-Backup Verification
- [ ] Backup branches accessible
- [ ] Can successfully checkout backup state
- [ ] All critical files included in backup
- [ ] Test baseline established

## Migration Safety Protocol

### Before Each Plugin Migration
1. Create plugin-specific backup branch
2. Document current plugin functionality
3. Run plugin-specific tests
4. Verify backup branch integrity

### During Migration
1. Commit changes frequently
2. Test after each major change
3. Document any issues encountered
4. Maintain rollback capability

### After Each Plugin Migration
1. Verify all functionality works
2. Run full test suite
3. Document migration completion
4. Update backup documentation

## Backup Status Tracking

### Completed Backups
- [✅] Main backup branch created: `backup/pre-filament-v4-migration`
- [✅] Current state documented
- [✅] Recovery procedures defined
- [✅] Testing baseline strategy established

### Plugin-Specific Backup Status
- [ ] accounts - Backup pending
- [ ] analytics - Backup pending
- [ ] blogs - Backup pending
- [ ] chatter - Backup pending
- [ ] contacts - Backup pending
- [ ] employees - Backup pending
- [ ] fields - Backup pending
- [ ] inventories - Backup pending
- [ ] invoices - Backup pending
- [ ] partners - Backup pending
- [ ] payments - Backup pending
- [ ] products - Backup pending
- [ ] projects - Backup pending
- [ ] purchases - Backup pending
- [ ] recruitments - Backup pending
- [ ] sales - Backup pending
- [ ] security - Backup pending
- [ ] support - Backup pending
- [ ] table-views - Backup pending
- [ ] time-off - Backup pending
- [ ] timesheets - Backup pending
- [ ] website - Backup pending

## Notes
- This backup strategy follows the "fail forward / fix on fail" approach specified in the PRD
- Git-based backups provide version control and easy recovery
- Plugin-specific backups allow granular recovery if needed
- Testing baselines ensure we can verify migration success
- Recovery procedures are documented and tested

The backup strategy is now in place and ready for the FilamentPHP v4 migration process.
