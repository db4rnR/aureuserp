# Runtime Compatibility Monitoring Strategy - FilamentPHP v4 Migration

**Date Created:** December 19, 2024  
**Purpose:** Establish monitoring and validation procedures to detect and resolve runtime compatibility issues during the FilamentPHP v4 migration process

## Overview

This document outlines the strategy for monitoring runtime compatibility issues that may arise during the FilamentPHP v4 migration. It provides procedures for early detection, validation checkpoints, and resolution strategies to ensure a smooth migration process.

## Runtime Compatibility Monitoring Framework

### 1. Pre-Migration Environment Validation

**Objective:** Ensure the environment is ready for migration and establish baseline performance metrics

**Validation Steps:**
- [ ] Verify PHP version compatibility (PHP 8.1+ required for FilamentPHP v4)
- [ ] Confirm Laravel version compatibility (Laravel 10+ required)
- [ ] Validate Composer dependencies resolve without conflicts
- [ ] Test basic application functionality (login, navigation, basic CRUD)
- [ ] Establish baseline performance metrics (page load times, memory usage)
- [ ] Document current error logs and warning levels

**Success Criteria:**
- Application loads without fatal errors
- All core functionality accessible
- No blocking dependency conflicts
- Performance baseline established

### 2. Migration Phase Monitoring

**Objective:** Monitor for compatibility issues as each plugin is migrated

#### 2.1 Per-Plugin Migration Monitoring

For each plugin being migrated:

**Pre-Migration Checks:**
- [ ] Run plugin-specific tests to establish baseline
- [ ] Verify plugin loads without errors
- [ ] Test core plugin functionality
- [ ] Document current performance metrics

**During Migration Monitoring:**
- [ ] Monitor for PHP fatal errors and exceptions
- [ ] Watch for deprecation warnings and notices
- [ ] Track memory usage and performance changes
- [ ] Validate form submissions and data processing
- [ ] Test infolist rendering and data display
- [ ] Verify table operations (filtering, sorting, searching)
- [ ] Check action execution and notifications

**Post-Migration Validation:**
- [ ] Run full plugin test suite
- [ ] Verify all functionality works identically
- [ ] Compare performance metrics with baseline
- [ ] Check for new errors or warnings in logs
- [ ] Test integration with other plugins

#### 2.2 System-Wide Compatibility Monitoring

**Continuous Monitoring During Migration:**
- [ ] Application error logs monitoring
- [ ] PHP error logs monitoring
- [ ] Laravel logs monitoring
- [ ] Database query performance monitoring
- [ ] Memory usage tracking
- [ ] Response time monitoring

### 3. Common Runtime Compatibility Issues

#### 3.1 FilamentPHP v4 Specific Issues

**Form Component Issues:**
- Method signature mismatches (`form(Schema $schema)` vs `form(Form $form)`)
- Component import path changes (`Filament\Schemas\Components\*` vs `Filament\Forms\Components\*`)
- Schema method call changes (`$schema->components([])` vs `$form->schema([])`)

**Infolist Component Issues:**
- Infolist method signature changes
- Component namespace changes for infolists
- Display logic compatibility

**Action System Issues:**
- Action class import changes
- Method signature updates
- Notification system changes

#### 3.2 Dependency Compatibility Issues

**Common Dependency Problems:**
- Version conflicts between FilamentPHP v4 and existing packages
- Breaking changes in dependent packages
- Namespace conflicts
- Method signature changes in dependencies

#### 3.3 Performance Compatibility Issues

**Performance Degradation Indicators:**
- Increased page load times
- Higher memory usage
- Slower database queries
- Timeout errors
- Resource exhaustion

### 4. Monitoring Tools and Procedures

#### 4.1 Automated Monitoring

**Log Monitoring:**
```bash
# Monitor application logs for errors
tail -f storage/logs/laravel.log | grep -E "(ERROR|FATAL|Exception)"

# Monitor PHP error logs
tail -f /var/log/php_errors.log

# Monitor web server error logs
tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log  # or Apache equivalent
```

**Performance Monitoring:**
```bash
# Monitor memory usage during migration
php artisan tinker --execute="echo memory_get_usage(true) / 1024 / 1024 . ' MB';"

# Test page load times
curl -w "@curl-format.txt" -o /dev/null -s "http://localhost/admin"
```

#### 4.2 Manual Validation Procedures

**Functional Testing Checklist:**
- [ ] Login and authentication
- [ ] Navigation and menu access
- [ ] Resource listing pages
- [ ] Form creation and editing
- [ ] Data validation and saving
- [ ] Infolist data display
- [ ] Table filtering and sorting
- [ ] Action execution
- [ ] File uploads and downloads
- [ ] Notification display

**Cross-Plugin Integration Testing:**
- [ ] Data relationships between plugins
- [ ] Shared components and services
- [ ] Permission and access control
- [ ] Workflow integrations

### 5. Issue Resolution Procedures

#### 5.1 Error Classification

**Critical Issues (Migration Blocking):**
- Fatal PHP errors preventing application load
- Database connection failures
- Authentication system failures
- Core functionality completely broken

**High Priority Issues:**
- Form submission failures
- Data corruption or loss
- Security vulnerabilities
- Performance degradation >50%

**Medium Priority Issues:**
- UI rendering problems
- Non-critical feature failures
- Performance degradation 20-50%
- Warning messages in logs

**Low Priority Issues:**
- Cosmetic UI issues
- Performance degradation <20%
- Non-critical deprecation warnings

#### 5.2 Resolution Workflow

**For Critical and High Priority Issues:**
1. **Immediate Response:** Stop migration, document issue
2. **Analysis:** Identify root cause and impact scope
3. **Resolution:** Implement fix or rollback if necessary
4. **Validation:** Test fix thoroughly
5. **Documentation:** Update monitoring procedures if needed

**For Medium and Low Priority Issues:**
1. **Documentation:** Log issue with details
2. **Prioritization:** Schedule resolution based on impact
3. **Resolution:** Implement fix during next maintenance window
4. **Validation:** Test fix and update documentation

### 6. Rollback Procedures

#### 6.1 Plugin-Level Rollback

**When to Rollback:**
- Critical functionality broken
- Data integrity compromised
- Performance unacceptably degraded
- Multiple high-priority issues

**Rollback Steps:**
1. Switch to backup branch: `git checkout backup/pre-filament-v4-migration`
2. Restore specific plugin files if needed
3. Clear caches: `php artisan cache:clear`, `php artisan config:clear`
4. Run tests to verify rollback success
5. Document rollback reason and lessons learned

#### 6.2 System-Wide Rollback

**Emergency Rollback Procedure:**
1. Switch to backup branch completely
2. Restore database from backup if needed
3. Clear all caches and compiled files
4. Restart web server and queue workers
5. Validate system functionality
6. Notify stakeholders of rollback

### 7. Monitoring Checkpoints
