# Product Requirements Document: FilamentPHP v4 Plugin Refactoring

## Introduction/Overview

The AureusERP project currently contains 20 plugins under `plugins/webkul/` that use a custom schema system instead of idiomatic FilamentPHP v4 patterns. This refactoring initiative aims to migrate all plugins to use standard FilamentPHP v4 components, forms, tables, and infolists to improve maintainability, performance, and alignment with the FilamentPHP ecosystem.

**Problem Statement**: The current plugin implementation uses custom `Filament\Schemas\*` components instead of standard FilamentPHP v4 patterns, making the codebase harder to maintain, debug, and extend. This also prevents the project from leveraging the full power and community support of FilamentPHP v4.

**Goal**: Refactor all 20 webkul plugins to use idiomatic FilamentPHP v4 patterns while maintaining existing functionality and data compatibility.

## Goals

1. **Standardization**: Convert all custom schema implementations to standard FilamentPHP v4 patterns
2. **Maintainability**: Improve code maintainability by using well-documented FilamentPHP v4 conventions
3. **Performance**: Leverage FilamentPHP v4 optimizations and best practices
4. **Developer Experience**: Make the codebase more accessible to developers familiar with FilamentPHP v4
5. **Future-Proofing**: Ensure compatibility with future FilamentPHP updates and community packages

## User Stories

**As a developer working on AureusERP:**
- I want to use standard FilamentPHP v4 form components so that I can leverage existing documentation and community resources
- I want consistent patterns across all plugins so that I can work efficiently across different modules
- I want to use standard FilamentPHP v4 table and infolist components so that I can implement features faster

**As a system administrator:**
- I want the application to use standard FilamentPHP patterns so that it's easier to find developers who can maintain the system
- I want improved performance from using optimized FilamentPHP v4 components

**As a project maintainer:**
- I want the codebase to follow FilamentPHP v4 conventions so that it's easier to onboard new developers
- I want to be able to use FilamentPHP community packages without compatibility issues

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Form Component Migration

    1.1. Replace all `Filament\Schemas\Schema` usage in form methods with `Filament\Forms\Form`
    1.2. Convert `public static function form(Schema $schema): Schema` to `public static function form(Form $form): Form`
    1.3. Replace `Filament\Schemas\Components\*` imports with `Filament\Forms\Components\*`
    1.4. Update all form component configurations to use FilamentPHP v4 syntax
    1.5. Ensure all form validation and behavior remains identical

### 2. Infolist Component Migration

    2.1. Replace all `Filament\Schemas\Schema` usage in infolist methods with `Filament\Infolists\Infolist`
    2.2. Convert `public static function infolist(Schema $schema): Schema` to `public static function infolist(Infolist $infolist): Infolist`
    2.3. Replace schema-based infolist components with `Filament\Infolists\Components\*`
    2.4. Maintain all existing display logic and formatting

### 3. Action System Migration

    3.1. Update all action imports to use standard FilamentPHP v4 action classes
    3.2. Replace custom action implementations with FilamentPHP v4 table actions, header actions, and bulk actions
    3.3. Ensure all action notifications and success/error handling work correctly
    3.4. Maintain existing action permissions and authorization logic

### 4. Table Component Verification

    4.1. Verify all table implementations already use standard FilamentPHP v4 patterns
    4.2. Update any non-standard table configurations to use FilamentPHP v4 best practices
    4.3. Ensure all table filters, sorting, and search functionality works correctly

### 5. Plugin-Specific Requirements

    5.1. Process all 20 plugins: accounts, analytics, blogs, chatter, contacts, employees, fields, inventories, invoices, partners, payments, products, projects, purchases, recruitments, sales, security, support, table-views, time-off, timesheets, website
    5.2. Maintain all existing functionality for each plugin
    5.3. Preserve all database relationships and data integrity
    5.4. Keep all existing translations and localization

### 6. Testing and Validation

    6.1. All existing functionality must work identically after refactoring
    6.2. All forms must validate and save data correctly
    6.3. All tables must display, filter, and sort data correctly
    6.4. All infolists must display data with proper formatting
    6.5. All actions must execute successfully with proper notifications

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **Database Schema Changes**: No changes to existing database tables or relationships
2. **Feature Additions**: No new features or functionality beyond the refactoring
3. **UI/UX Changes**: No changes to the visual appearance or user experience
4. **Performance Optimization**: Beyond what's gained from using standard FilamentPHP v4 components
5. **Translation Updates**: No changes to existing translation keys or language files
6. **Third-Party Package Updates**: No updates to other packages beyond FilamentPHP-related dependencies

## Technical Considerations

### Dependencies

- FilamentPHP v4.x (reference: https://filamentphp.com/docs/4.x/)
- Existing Laravel and PHP version compatibility
- All current plugin dependencies must remain functional

### Migration Strategy

1. **Plugin-by-Plugin Approach**: Refactor one plugin at a time to minimize risk
2. **Backward Compatibility**: Ensure no breaking changes to existing data or configurations
3. **Testing Priority**: Thoroughly test each plugin before moving to the next
4. **Documentation**: Update any plugin-specific documentation to reflect new patterns

### Key Technical Changes

- Replace `Filament\Schemas\*` namespace usage with appropriate FilamentPHP v4 namespaces
- Update method signatures from `Schema $schema` to appropriate FilamentPHP v4 types (`Form $form`, `Infolist $infolist`)
- Convert custom schema components to standard FilamentPHP v4 components
- Update import statements throughout all plugin files

### Integration Points

- Must integrate with existing `.ai/guidelines` and project architecture patterns
- Should follow the plugin architecture guidelines in `.ai/guidelines/050-plugin-architecture.md`
- Must maintain compatibility with the MCP server context7 system

## Success Metrics

1. **Code Quality**: 100% of plugins use standard FilamentPHP v4 patterns
2. **Functionality**: All existing features work identically after refactoring
3. **Performance**: No degradation in application performance (ideally improvement)
4. **Developer Experience**: Reduced time for new developers to understand and work with plugin code
5. **Maintainability**: Easier debugging and troubleshooting using standard FilamentPHP patterns
6. **Documentation Alignment**: All code follows patterns documented in FilamentPHP v4 official documentation

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Foundation (High Priority)
- accounts, contacts, partners (core business entities)

### Phase 2: Financial (High Priority)  
- invoices, payments, purchases (financial operations)

### Phase 3: Operations (Medium Priority)
- products, inventories, sales (operational modules)

### Phase 4: Human Resources (Medium Priority)
- employees, recruitments, time-off, timesheets (HR modules)

### Phase 5: Supporting Features (Lower Priority)
- analytics, blogs, chatter, fields, projects, security, support, table-views, website (supporting features)

## Project Timeline and Resources

### Timeline
- **Deadline**: Complete by close of business, 2025-06-30
- **Current Date**: 2025-06-18
- **Available Time**: 12 business days

### Resource Allocation
- **Team Size**: 2 developers
- **Estimated Effort**: ~6 days per developer (based on 20 plugins across 5 phases)

### Testing Strategy
- **Requirement**: 100% pass rate for all unit tests
- **Approach**: Each plugin must pass all existing unit tests after refactoring
- **Validation**: Run full test suite after each plugin refactoring

### Quality Assurance
- **Validation Process**: The User will review and approve each refactored plugin
- **Rollback Strategy**: Fail forward / fix on fail approach (no rollback plan needed)

### Documentation Requirements
- **Updates Required**: Yes, plugin-specific documentation will be updated as part of this effort
- **Scope**: Update any documentation that references the old schema patterns

## Acceptance Criteria
