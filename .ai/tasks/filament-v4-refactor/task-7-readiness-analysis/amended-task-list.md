## Task 7.0 Readiness Checklist

Before marking Task 7.0 as ready for execution, ensure:

### Critical Prerequisites
- [ ] All 22 main project plugins show 100% migration completion
- [ ] Migration validation scripts report no issues
- [ ] All plugin tests are discoverable and passing
- [ ] Performance baselines are established and documented
- [ ] Task list accurately reflects actual completion status

### Validation Requirements
- [ ] No `Filament\Schemas\Schema` imports found in any main project plugin
- [ ] All form methods use `Form $form` parameter and return type
- [ ] All infolist methods use `Infolist $infolist` parameter and return type
- [ ] All closure parameters use correct FilamentPHP v4 types
- [ ] All layout components use appropriate namespaces

### Testing Requirements
- [ ] Minimum 1 test per plugin (22 tests minimum)
- [ ] All existing tests passing (100% pass rate)
- [ ] Test discovery issues resolved
- [ ] Integration tests between plugins working
- [ ] Performance regression tests in place

## Timeline Estimates

### Task 6.5: Migration Completion Audit
- **Duration:** 3-4 days
- **Critical Path:** Plugin audit and remediation
- **Dependencies:** None

### Task 6.6: Testing Infrastructure
- **Duration:** 2-3 days
- **Critical Path:** Test creation and validation
- **Dependencies:** Task 6.5 completion for accurate testing

### Task 7.0: Third-Party Package Migration
- **Duration:** 2-3 days
- **Critical Path:** Package migration and validation
- **Dependencies:** Tasks 6.5 and 6.6 completion

**Total Additional Time Required:** 7-10 days before Task 7.0 can proceed safely

## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Areas
1. **Plugin Interdependencies:** Some plugins may depend on others for functionality
2. **Complex Migration Cases:** Large plugins (employees, sales, inventories) may have complex patterns
3. **Test Environment:** Database and environment setup for comprehensive testing

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Incremental Approach:** Complete one plugin at a time with full validation
2. **Rollback Procedures:** Maintain ability to rollback individual plugin migrations
3. **Staging Environment:** Use dedicated testing environment for validation
4. **Documentation:** Maintain detailed logs of all changes and issues

## Success Criteria

Task 7.0 will be considered ready when:

1. **100% Plugin Migration:** All main project plugins fully migrated and validated
2. **Comprehensive Testing:** All plugins have adequate test coverage and pass
3. **Performance Validation:** No performance degradation detected
4. **Documentation Accuracy:** Task list reflects actual completion status
5. **Tool Validation:** All migration tools working correctly
6. **Integration Verification:** Cross-plugin functionality confirmed working

This amended task list ensures a systematic and thorough approach to preparing for Task 7.0, addressing all identified blocking issues and establishing a solid foundation for third-party package migration.
