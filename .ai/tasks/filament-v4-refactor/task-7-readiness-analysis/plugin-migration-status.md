## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Complete partners plugin migration** - This is blocking other work and has the lowest completion rate
2. **Quick fix for timesheets** - Only 1 file needs attention, can be done quickly
3. **Systematic approach to employees plugin** - Large plugin requiring careful migration

### Next Steps

1. Run migration validator on all remaining 14 plugins to get complete picture
2. Focus remediation efforts on plugins with <90% completion
3. Validate cross-plugin dependencies after each plugin is fixed
4. Update this status document as plugins are completed
