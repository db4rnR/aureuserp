# Testing Environment Configuration

## Issue Description
create a .env.testing, with sensible defaults for a test environment (e.g. sqlite, in-memory)
where needed, copy values from .env
when the task is complete. append to the transcript of this conversation

## Solution Summary
I've created a `.env.testing` file with sensible defaults for a test environment. The key configurations include:

1. **Database Configuration**:
   - Set up SQLite in-memory database for testing
   - `DB_CONNECTION=sqlite`
   - `DB_DATABASE=:memory:`

2. **Performance Optimizations**:
   - Reduced `BCRYPT_ROUNDS` to 4 for faster password hashing
   - Simplified localization to only use English

3. **Testing-Specific Drivers**:
   - Session: `array`
   - Cache: `array`
   - Mail: `array`
   - Queue: `sync`

4. **Disabled Features**:
   - Pulse: `PULSE_ENABLED=false`
   - Telescope: `TELESCOPE_ENABLED=false`

5. **Copied Values**:
   - Maintained app identity values (APP_NAME, APP_URL)
   - Kept the same APP_KEY for encryption consistency
   - Preserved logging configuration

This configuration ensures tests run quickly and in isolation, without affecting any external systems or persistent storage.

## Implementation Details
The `.env.testing` file was created based on the existing `.env` file, with modifications to make it suitable for a testing environment. The configuration aligns with the settings in `phpunit.xml`, which already had some testing environment variables defined but had the SQLite in-memory database configuration commented out.

By using an in-memory SQLite database, tests can run quickly and in complete isolation, with each test starting with a fresh database state.
