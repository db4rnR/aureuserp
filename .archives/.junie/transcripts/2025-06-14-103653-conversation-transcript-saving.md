# Conversation Transcript Saving

## Issue Description
save a transcript of this conversation in a suitably-named file within `.junie/transcripts`

## Solution Summary
I've created two transcript files in the `.junie/transcripts` directory:

1. **Previous Conversation Transcript**:
   - Created `pest-testing-implementation.md` to document the previous conversation about implementing Pest tests
   - Included the issue description and a comprehensive summary of the solution

2. **Current Conversation Transcript**:
   - Created this file (`conversation-transcript-saving.md`) to document the current conversation
   - Following the same format with issue description and solution summary

The transcript files follow the existing naming convention in the directory (kebab-case with descriptive names) and use Markdown formatting for better readability.

## Process
1. Checked if the `.junie/transcripts` directory existed (it did)
2. Examined existing files to understand the naming convention
3. Created appropriate transcript files with meaningful content
4. Verified the files were created successfully

This completes the requirement to save transcripts of our conversations in the specified location.
